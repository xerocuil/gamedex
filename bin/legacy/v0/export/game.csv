### Level Mode / Level Challenge

In Level Mode, users attempt to satisfy all of the requirements in order to qualify for the next level. These requirements include:

1. **Largest Combo:** The largest number of Swirls that are removed in one move at any point during the current level.
2. **Number of Singles:** A swirl that is not connected to any other swirls of the same color is called a ""Single"". You can remove Singles at any time, but there is a -100 point penalty for each Single that is removed. To satisfy this requirement, the user can only remove the number of Singles specified (or less). If the user removes all of the Swirls in the current level without removing any Singles, their score for the current level will be doubled.
3. **Big Column Bonus:** Whenever a user removes all of the remaining swirls from a column, they receive a Column Bonus. The more columns that can be removed in a single move, the larger the Column Bonus. If the Big Column Bonus requirement for a level is 3, the user must remove 3 Columns in a single move at some point within that level to satisfy this requirement.
4. **Total Combos:** Each time you remove a group of swirls (of any size) this counts as a Combo. To satisfy this requirement, you must do less moves than the number of combos allowed. This requirement is almost impossible not to satisfy and has been included for future support and additional levels.
5. **Score:** This requirement is the total points that the user has scored for the current level. This includes points for combos, column bonuses and penalty points for Singles. The SEGA Dreamcast version also includes Time Bonus for Timed Modes of Level Challenge and Single Game Challenge (Practice Mode). Once again, if the user removes all of the Swirls in the current level without removing any Singles, their score for the current level will be doubled.
6. **Time:** The SEGA Dreamcast version of the game includes Timed and Untimed options for both Level Challenge and Single Game Challenge. In the Timed Modes, the user is given 120 seconds to remove all of the Swirls If the user removes all of the Swirls before the time runs out, they are given a 50 point bonus for every second remaining on the clock. If the time runs out before the user completes the current level, they fail to satisfy this option and will lose the current level. The points earned during the time bonus are added to the overall score for the level and can help the user to satisfy the score requirement. This requirement is only included in the SEGA Dreamcast version of SEGA Swirl.

### Practice Mode / Single Game Challenge

The gameplay is very similar to Level Mode except the game is complete after all of the Swirls have been removed. If the user removes all of the Swirls without removing any Singles in a Practice Mode game, their score for that game will be doubled.

### Versus Mode / Versus Challenge

In Versus Mode, two to four players can compete in a head-to-head challenge where each player is trying to have the most points at the end of the game.

1. Each player can be a human or computer opponent and is designated a color: Player 1 is Orange, Player 2 is Blue, Player 3 is Purple, and Player 4 is Green.
2. Swirls of your own color are worth twice as much for you. If Player 1 does a combo of 3 blue swirls, it is worth 20 points, but a combo of 3 orange swirls iworth 40 points to player 1. Watch out for singles of your own color. Since Singles are worth -100 points, Singles of your own color are worth -200 points!!
3. When all of the Swirls of your color have been removed, you are knocked out of the game. Sometimes it is good to get knocked out of the game, other times yowant to try to stay in as long as possible!
4. When all of the players have been knocked out, the game is finished.


### Swirl Email Mode / Email Challenge

The gameplay is very similar to Versus Mode except each turn is sent over email. PC and SEGA Dreamcast users can play head-to-head with up to four players in a Swirl Email Game."	0	Windows 95	40		2	166 MHz	SEGA	16 MB	NA					Sega Swirl	0	2000

This ship's duty is to escort the Von Braun, an experimental faster-than-light starship, on its maiden voyage.

Instead of offering several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush). The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club."

The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock. Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.

While the game remains mostly the same as the original, the graphics and sound have been completely overhauled. The graphics are fully 3D rendered and are similar in design to Yoshi's Story. Bonk has a meaner look and practically every sound effect is spelled out on-screen. Some of the levels are altered. Fruit is not as common and there are no crystal hearts, but lives are much more plentiful.

Your world is infested with monsters and your job is to destroy them. Along the way you meet other golems that you need to revive so that they can join your quest. Your ultimate goal is to defeat Azrael.

RPG elements are fairly standard with hit points, magic points, speed, mobility, skills, etc. Each golem type has specific abilities, for example, Priest is strong in Light Magic whereas Archer is strong in arrow attacks. General movement is done on the World map, which is divided into Fields, and the player is able to see which Fields are occupied by the enemy. Shops are only accessible on the World map. Selecting a Field takes the group of golems into a Field map which is presented in pseudo-3D.

Players can freely travel the Field map, finding treasures and other items, periodically bumping into enemy groups. Battles are fought in turns on the same map, there is no separate battle screen. Movement is into main compass directions only and the player controls the whole group when traveling. Only during battle are each group member individually controllable."	Micro Cabin Co.

Equipped with a fishing line, she can swing and abseil from platform to platform using it as a grappling hook. The game's specialty is the detailed physics system that allows Kawase to perform various tricks using the elastic and length variable rope to move around the levels. There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order.

Lots of enemies stand in his way: flying robot drones, armed guards, The Hand ninjas and Inner Circle bodyguards, among others.

When Wolverine takes damage, his mutant healing factor kicks in, (slowly) regenerating his health.

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.

Feeling a little tired from playing video games late the night before, he looked around for a comfortable place to finish his comic.

Without thinking, Lester stretched out on a pallet that was ready for loading onto a nearby freighter. And fell asleep.

Boy, did he pick a bad place to take a nap. Several hours out of port he woke up and found himself in deep trouble (and more than a little seasick). The ship's captain believed his story about being an accidental stowaway. But... only in cases of extreme medical emergency could the ship return to port. And Lester wasn't that seasick. Yet...

So, he was along for the ride... until the first port of call. But as chance would have it, pirates hijacked and scuttled the freighter. Luckily enough, Lester found a life vest before the ship sank and swam for the nearest tropical island.

Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out from sheer exhaustion. Now, his real adventure begins...

It is up to you to help Lester get back home.

They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level.

Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.

Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.

Controlling one of the on-board officers, the player has to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, they can be sucked out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where the protagonist must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.

In addition, up to ten droids are under the player's indirect control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As the officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.

Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions. The main goal in such cases is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, a self-destruct mechanism will detonate the station in sixty minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease."

In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.

The heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game.

However since Star Trek is a license, several names have been changed to avoid infringing the copyright, but the gameplay remains intact.

The game itself is simple. Each sector of the universe is an 8x8 grid containing planets, starbases, friendly or enemy starships and suns. Within this sector you can navigate to any point on the grid with impulse engines, or venture to a new sector using Warp engines. Your ship is equipped with lasers and torpedos to help defend yourself, and scanners to assess the nearby threats and nearby sectors. Additionally you'll need to find starbases for quick repairs and to resupply and may also discover new and unusual planets to beam down and explore. A nice touch to EGA Trek over all other clones is a *viewscreen* window which provides a crude graphic view of nearby objects.

Two distinct empires make your enemies list. The Mongols are the forces you'll run into again and again. Armed battle cruisers of various strengths. The other enemy are the Vandal, seen only in 1 type of ship, but able to cloak and avoid your sensors.

Should your vessel suffer enough damage, various systems will begin to fail and quite possibly you'll be down to your final reserve power and life support. From this point, sustaining more damage or not being able to repair the ship will result in the deaths of all crew members aboard and the ultimate failure of your mission. Success on the other hand is brought about by clearing the entire galaxy of hostile Mongol and Vandal fleets... with bonuses for discoveries, rescues and living crew members."

The core gameplay has been changed little, with Kirby absorbing enemies in order to take their powers. In addition to a graphical update, some level designs have been altered, the mini-bosses have been increased in size, one of whom (the rolling turtle) has been replaced with an elephant-like creature, and two new mini-games replace the claw and egg eating mini-games from the original, both of which feature a multiplayer option. Air Grind involves Kirby grinding racing against clones of himself by grinding a warp star against a rail, while Bomb Rally involves the four Kirbys tossing a bomb between each other using frying pans.

Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in real-time combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.

**Weapons:** New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.

**Presentation:** The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).

However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.

All he wants is to go home to his girlfriend Berri, but it seems that an unknown force has thrown him into another world. The ruler of said world, the dumb, but vicious Panther King, is having a serious problem: he has been just drinking milk when he discovered that the table in his throne room is missing one of its legs. Unable to solve the problem by himself, the enraged monarch sends for the mad weasel scientist, Professor Von Kriplespac, who suggests a red squirrel as a replacement for the table's lost leg.

The action itself features no big surprises: the players control their characters over the scrolling tennis field and try to counter balls from their opponents. It is possible to perform typical tennis actions like cross, smash or lob and the hit performance depends on the timing.

However, the unique feature of this game is a story mode which takes various elements from Japanese role-playing games. The story involves an evil king who banned all tennis matches outside of membership courts. The player goes out to overthrow the king so tennis can be brought back to everyone. So the player explores a top-down world map reminiscent of Dragon Warrior, explores the surrounding and fights enemies. Those fights are either random encounters or scripted boss battles and play out as regular tennis matches."

The game display is always in split screen mode, even if only one player is playing. The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer.

There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest. Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship. There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1. Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.

Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin. This is essentially a racing RPG. You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion. To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car.

You control the creature Puggsy, who has crash landed on an alien planet and had his spaceship stolen. Your goal is to find the spaceship so you can get off the planet and return home. To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments. Throughout each level are a variety of objects which you can pick up; on many of the levels you will need to figure out how to use the objects available to you in order to reach the exit. Some objects can be used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked. Of course, each level will also have a variety of bad guys wandering about which will cost Puggsy one of his lives if he's caught.

This device was told to contain ultimate knowledge and wisdom; however, only those aware of its secrets could hope to choose the right approach towards it. Should The System be accessed the wrong way, it would transfer itself into an instrument of immense destruction. Human beings took that risk, and were punished: The System activated its defense mechanism, and used its weapons against the human race. Years have passed, and the humans managed to learn the techniques contained within The System. Now only one task was left: to shut down The System itself...

First and foremost is the return of Assault mode from the original Unreal Tournament. This mode pits two teams, attackers and defenders, against each other. The attackers must try to complete various objectives, and the defenders have to stop them. At the end of the round, whether time runs out or the attackers win, the roles are switched, and the defenders become the attackers. A mode new to 2004 is Onslaught. Another team-based mode, there are several Power Nodes spread throughout the map, with one base per team that houses a large Power Core. The players must go to each Power Node, link it to the enemy Core, and eventually attack the enemy Power Core itself. Rounding out the remainder of the game modes is the standard Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Double Domination, Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Invasion, and Mutant, for a total of ten different game modes. An additional official game mode is Vehicle CTF, which will only appear in the gametype browser after the user adds a VCTF map in the Maps directory, be it an official VCTF map (released after the game was published) or releases from amateur mapmakers.

The series' trademark unit, the Horned Reaper, is now only called through a special support power and only one can be found on the map at a given moment. Spells are now cast using mana (an auto-generating resource proportional to the size of the dungeon) instead of gold, and can be upgraded once there are no new spells to research.
